Fun 2 player game with the dice in the center game_die . Always this stupid random dice, right?

Easy-to-play game written in pure JS, but possibly this is not what you want to know about but more about the rules of the game.

Rules of the game
The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
